BIOL770: Classic models in Ecology
Tuesdays, 10-10:50 AM; T.H. Morgan 108
Instructor:
	Dr. Jake Ferguson
	319 TH Morgan Building

Course description:
The purpose of this course is to familiarize you with the models of ecological processes that have had large impacts on the current state of the field. We will have readings every other week and practicals in odd-weeks. Each student will be responsible for discussion of one topic, which will likely include two scientific manuscripts.
	 	 	 	
Course Objectives:
This course has two main objectives: (1) to improve studentsâ€™ grasp on the historical significance of modeling in ecology, and (2) to develop some basic skills in working with these models.

	 	 	 	
Required readings:
Papers will be selected by the instructor every other week.

	 	 	 	
Course evaluation:
Participation (75% of grade): Participation for this course will be graded weekly and consists of:
In-class participation during discussion: Those who are not leading the discussion will still need to participate to earn full credit. This entails asking questions during discussion, contributing a thoughtful comment for discussion, or bringing up topics that may have been missed by the instructor and discussion leader. 
In-class participation during practicals: 

Leading a discussion (25% of grade): A discussion leader will be responsible for keeping one discussion going. To be prepared the leader should have a list of topics prepared that could include a description of the properties of the model, the critical assumptions of the model, limitations of the model, and applications of the model. Discussions may cover questions such as, what are the critical assumptions of this model? What biological processes are missing from the model and why does it or does it not matter? What kind of data would be needed to test the model? Why is this model of historical importance to ecologists? The instructor will be happy to meet with you beforehand to work through any questions you might have.
